## UNIX Shell

The goal of our project to build a simple replica of a UNIX shell that can execute core commands frequently used in a shell. Our minimum viable product will be to build a shell that initializes, interprets commands and terminates. The shell will contain 3-5 commands for any user to execute.

We have a list of different stretch goals that we will look towards completing depending on how far along we are with our MVP. The goals are to add on to MVP commands to achieve functionality as close to its actual UNIX implementation, add more functions, add piping/similar functionality, make the shell secure and avoid any common security flaws, and write unit tests for our code.

As a group we want to become more proficient at C and comfortable writing efficient C programs. This, of course, includes documenting both the code and the project! Because we are learning about the shell and shell commands we also want to gain more skills with the UNIX command line.

There are a variety of online resources that we’ve found to achieve these tasks. Here are a few of them:

[Write a Shell in C](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/)

[Making your own Linux Shell in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/making-linux-shell-c/)

[Simple C Shell](https://github.com/jmreyes/simple-c-shell)

[Writing Your Own Shell](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/grr/SystemsProgrammingBook/Book/Chapter5-WritingYourOwnShell.pdf)

Our first steps are will be to look at other implementations of shells as group and talk through them. We will also create a high-level plan for writing a shell and populate the trello board with the functions accordingly. Once we have understood these as a group we will begin to write our own shell based off of them. This includes initializing the shell loop, reading lines from the shell, parsing the lines, and executing commands, exiting the shell. We will each be point person for one of these and they will be considered done when they are working, but this doesn’t include errors and maybe won’t include every flag on each command for example. After this we will each will take ownership over writing an additional command.
